# Meet Hooks
*Hanging Up the Carcass of Class-Based React Components*

## Included are the following:
- Actual slides (keynote)
- PDF version of the slides
- Outline.md which I wrote as a blog post to flesh out the talk before I started making all the changes right on the slides
- Example project which was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and can be tinkered with and poked at. I plan to add more to it in the future but who knows what the future holds. :)
